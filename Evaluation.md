## Submission tracks

Participants will select one of three tracks in which to submit.

    - Undergraduate track. Open only to groups or individuals composed entirely of undergraduate students. Verification may be required to prove eligibility.
    
    - Metric track. Leverage pre-snap data to assess team or player performance and/or strategy to create a post-snap outcome. You may focus on offensive or defensive players, teams, or individuals. In general, the more narrow the focus, the better the paper.
    
    - Coaching presentation track. Analyze and present data in a submission designed for coaches (e.g, a scouting report). We encourage participants interested in this track to partner with a coach (or current/former player), though this isnâ€™t required.

Note: For this year, the Coaching Presentation Track will be requiring submissions in the form of a slide presentation saved as a PDF. Please upload your PDF slides as a Kaggle Dataset, and ensure that dataset is public prior to the submission deadline of January 6, 2025. In your submission form, please provide the URL to the Kaggle Dataset for review.

## Scoring

An entry to the competition consists of a Notebook submission that is evaluated on the following four components, where 0 is the lowest and 10 is the highest.

### Football Score (30%)

    - Does the analysis account for variables that make football data complex?
    - Are the ideas unique?

### Data Science Score (30%)

    - Is the work correct?
    - Are claims backed up by data?
    - Are the statistical models appropriate given the data?
    - Are the analytical applications innovative?

### Report Score (20%)

    - Is the report well-written?
    - Is the report easy to follow?
    - Is the motivation (metric, player evaluation, etc) clearly defined?

### Data Visualization Score (20%)
